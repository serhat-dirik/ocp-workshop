## Lab: Canary Release to Production

### Background: Canary Release


#### Exercise: TBD

Got to Gogs and change "National Parks" name to "National Parks Geo" in `src/main/java/com/openshift/evg/roadshow/parks/rest/BackendController.java`.
Commit the change to trigger the pipeline and wait at "Input Required" in pipeline

Make Router to do round robin

[source]
----
$ oc annotate route/nationalparks-live haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin
----

Test the route

[source]
----
for i in {1..10}; do curl http://nationalparks-live-demo.10.2.2.15.xip.io/ws/info/ ; echo "" ; done
----


Open parksmap in Chrome > Incognito or Firefox > New Private Window in order to disable caching. Refresh
the page a few times and you should see every few requests the name of nationalparks in the right top menu changes.

When happy with the change, go to pipeline and click on promote to deploy the change in the live environment.
